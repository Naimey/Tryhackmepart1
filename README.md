# Tryhackmepart1
-When the started the Corona crisis in the Netherlands, I was following the Twitch channel and one of the channels was trying to find flags at the Tryhackme platform to understand cybersecurity and penetration concepts. When I took a look for Tryhackme platform which is including new and different types of the challenge. This platform is aiming to teach and show it the real concept of security. I like this concept because it has been different than the other type of platforms. 
-I finished lots of machines on this platform but as usual, I forgat present it my writeups. I decided to add the answers to all sections to the Github repo after last edits.
-If you think something or some part on my writeup is wrong or missing please let me know.
-I hope It can be helpful for you.
